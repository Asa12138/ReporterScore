Description: Inspired by the classic 'RSA', we developed the improved 'Generalized Reporter 
    Score-based Analysis (GRSA)' method, implemented in the R package 'ReporterScore', along 
    with comprehensive visualization methods and pathway databases. 'GRSA' is a threshold-free 
    method that works well with all types of biomedical features, such as genes, chemical compounds, 
    and microbial species. Importantly, the 'GRSA' supports multi-group and longitudinal experimental 
    designs, because of the included multi-group-compatible statistical methods.
